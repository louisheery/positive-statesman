# The Positive Statesman
GitHub Repo for MSc Group Project: "Sharing 'Positive' Stories using sentiment analysis"

## Christmas Holiday Work
1. Server Infastructure (Einar, Michael)
    - Web Hosting: Incl. seeing which hosting providers give us free credit for being students @ Imperial
    - Cloud Computing: Incl. Researching capabilities of Firebase, AWS etc
    - Backend Frameworks: Research which is best one(s) to use.
    
 2. Frontend Frameworks (Louis)
    - Frontend Frameworks: Research which is best one(s) to use.

3. ML Models & Classifiers (NLP, Text, Images) (Max S.)
    - Test out and compare capabilities of differnent ML Classifiers: Incl. Bert, Vadar, NLPK, ImageAI, etc.

4. Fetching Stories & APIs (Max C., Lenni)
    - APIs: Incl. Looking at potential APIs, ways to fetch news from websites, whether they are free etc.
    - RSS Feeds of Popular News sites
    - (Web crawling)
    
5. App Requirements (ALL)
    - User Stories & Flow Charts of User Actions on the Website
    - Features (Core & Addon Features) which we want to include in Website -> then which can go in the MVP.

### Libraries and Technologies to research
- NLP: NLP Toolkit, Bert, Vadar

## Repo Contents
### Product

### OLD Project Prep Work during Holidays
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Sentiment Analysis Model
    - Research different NLP Python Libraries to use
    - Find Labelled Open-source Datasets on Sentiment Analysis (any time, e.g. Twitter Data, News Data, Research Papers).
    - Make Basic NLP Model that reads in Text and picks out Key words
    - Make Sentiment Model that reads in Key words and outputs some sort of Sentiment score

- News Article Dataset Creation
    - Crawl some popular news sites to start building up our core dataset.
    - Research Python or other based Server side web crawling Libraries.
    - Research Google News API or alternatives that let you get links to recent news stories that have been published.
    
- Frontend Testing
    - Continue Mockup up of Design for Website, e.g. what pages it should contain, design aspect
    - Decide on best Web framework for website.
    - Build prototype mockup
    
- Backend Testing
    - Look at the Server-side hosting products avaliable e.g. Firebase, Parse Server
    - Set up Firebase account, and get basic Storage account up and running
    - Look and how Firebase or other integrates with ML and NLP Server-side products, and which it supports
