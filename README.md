# The Positive Statesman
GitHub Repo for MSc Group Project: "Sharing 'Positive' Stories using sentiment analysis"

## Git Tutorial
## How to Add Code
1. Update your 'Local' version of 'Master' Branch
```
git pull origin master
```

2. Create a new 'Local' version of a seperate Branch for which you are currently working on i.e. 'adding-react-router' Branch
```
git add
```

3. Push your 'adding-react-router' Branch to the 'Online' version. This automatically creates a pull request for 'adding-react-router' on Online version to be merged into 'Master' on Online version.
```
git push origin adding-react-router
```

And run a cleanup to delete this temporary 'adding-react-router' from the Local machine
```
git sweep
```

4. Merge 'adding-react-router' of Online version to the Master of Online version at some point in the future.
